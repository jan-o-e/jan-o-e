# About Me:
Hello there, I'm Jan, a quantum physics [PhD student](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/ernst) with a background in physics and philosophy. I am generally interested in quantum technologies, and particularly quantum computing. Currently, I am working on quantum information processing with neutral atoms. 

Beyond physics, I am really interested in blockchain software development and have partaken in several [hackathons](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/retr0x-2p73o).
